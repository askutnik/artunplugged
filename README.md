This system allows the user to retrieve PVGIS data for user based input, visualise it and then forecast solar irradiance and energy production based on parameters chosen by the user.
## Operating the system
Ensure that Python and all of the required libraries (*pandas, matplotlib, scikit_learn*) are installed on your machine locally. Run the program from the terminal by running this command:
```
streamlit run streamlit_dashboard.py
```
